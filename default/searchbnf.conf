shortdesc = Add/Remove an IP from a Dynamic Address Group in a Palo Alto Networks Firewall
description = Tag or remove tags for IP addresses on a Palo Alto Networks Firewall. Tags are leveraged to populate Dynamic Address Groups in a security policy which adds context to the security enforcement capabilities.

shortdesc = Synchronize user logins and logouts with a Palo Alto Networks Firewall
description = The User-ID system in a Palo Alto Networks Firewall can track user logins so you can write a security policy based on users and groups instead of IP addresses. Splunk can tell the firewall when users login or logout based on authentication logs received by Splunk. Send user logins to the User-ID firewall which will propagate the users to all other firewalls.
usage = public
example1 = sourcetype=radius login | panuserupdate device="10.1.1.1" action="login" ip_field="src_ip" user_field="username"
comment1 = When a radius authentication log is received by Splunk, tell the firewall that the user logged.
