"""Update users on the firewall from logs in Splunk

About this script
-----------------
User-ID is a mechanism in the firewall that maps users to IP addresses.
These User to IP mappings can be updated using many methods including from
Active Directory or by sending syslogs to a firewall from a Radius or other
authentication server.

Many organizations send authentication logs to Splunk, so it is natural for
Splunk to communicate these authentication events to the firewalls so their
User to IP mappings are always up-to-date.

There are two methods to synchronize authentication events from Splunk to the firewall:

  Method 1:  Forward logs from Splunk to the User-ID firewall.

  Method 2:  Use this script to update the firewall using its API.

Method 1 is preferred because it is more efficient.  However, Method 2 is
useful in cases where the user and the IP are not in the same logs. Splunk
can correlate the user to the IP before passing the mapping to the firewall
via API.

This script supports connection to a firewall or to Panorama.
